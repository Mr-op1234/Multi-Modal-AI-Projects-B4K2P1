Audio-Visual Source Separation refers to the process of isolating individual sources of sound or objects from audio and visual input. For example, in a video where multiple people are talking or different sounds are occurring, the goal is to separate the audio for each speaker or sound source based on the visual cues (e.g., which speaker’s face corresponds to which voice).

This technique can be applied to scenarios such as multi-speaker environments, video conferencing, or noise reduction where both audio and visual data are used to separate sources.

Step 1: Audio Separation
We use a simple audio separation technique based on voice activity detection (VAD) to detect speech segments and separate them.

Step 2: Visual Source Separation
We will use OpenCV for face detection to match each voice activity to the corresponding speaker in the video.

Step 3: Audio-Visual Matching
We combine both audio and visual features to map the detected speakers (faces) with the corresponding audio segments.

Here’s the Python implementation:

import cv2
import numpy as np
import librosa
from scipy.io import wavfile
from PIL import Image
from pydub import AudioSegment
from pydub.playback import play

# Step 1: Audio Separation using simple Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
def separate_audio_sources(audio_file):
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file, sr=None)

    # Basic Voice Activity Detection (simplified)
    onset_env = librosa.onset.onset_strength(y=y, sr=sr)
    peaks = librosa.onset.onset_detect(onset_envelope=onset_env, sr=sr, units='time')

    # Create segments based on detected peaks
    segments = []
    for i in range(len(peaks) - 1):
        start = int(peaks[i] * sr)
        end = int(peaks[i + 1] * sr)
        segments.append((start, end))

    return segments

# Step 2: Visual Source Separation (Face Detection for speaker matching)
def detect_faces_in_video(video_file):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_file)
    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

    face_frames = []
    frame_count = 0

    while True:
        success, frame = cap.read()
        if not success:
            break

        gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))

        if len(faces) > 0:
            face_frames.append(frame_count)  # Store the frame numbers with detected faces

        frame_count += 1

    cap.release()
    return face_frames

# Step 3: Combine Audio and Visual Source Separation
def separate_audio_and_visual_sources(audio_file, video_file):
    # Step 1: Separate audio based on voice activity detection
    audio_segments = separate_audio_sources(audio_file)
    print(f"Detected audio segments: {audio_segments}")

    # Step 2: Detect faces in the video
    face_frames = detect_faces_in_video(video_file)
    print(f"Frames with detected faces: {face_frames}")

    # Step 3: Match audio segments with faces (simplified)
    # For simplicity, assume that audio segments correspond to faces in video frames directly.
    # In real applications, we can use lip sync models or speaker recognition for more accurate matching.
    if len(audio_segments) > len(face_frames):
        print("More audio segments than faces detected.")
    else:
        for i in range(len(audio_segments)):
            print(f"Audio Segment {i + 1} (from {audio_segments[i][0]} to {audio_segments[i][1]}) matched to Face in Frame {face_frames[i]}.")

# Example inputs
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"  # Replace with a valid audio file
video_file = "example_video.mp4"  # Replace with a valid video file

# Perform audio-visual source separation
separate_audio_and_visual_sources(audio_file, video_file)
What This Does:
Audio Separation: It detects speech segments in the audio using onset detection with librosa. This is a simple method for detecting changes in audio that might correspond to speech events.

Visual Source Separation: It detects faces in the video using OpenCV's Haar Cascades for face detection. In practice, more advanced methods (e.g., YOLO or DeepFace) can be used for detecting multiple faces.

Audio-Visual Matching: It pairs the detected audio segments with the faces in the video, simulating how one might synchronize the speech with the corresponding speaker in the video. The matching is done based on frame numbers and audio events.

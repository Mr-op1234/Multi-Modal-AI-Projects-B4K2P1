Text-guided video editing systems allow users to modify video content based on textual descriptions, enabling applications like content creation and media manipulation. These systems can be used to change scenes, add effects, or even create entirely new content based on a text prompt.

For this project, we simulate text-guided video generation (an extension of text-to-image) using a video generation model. We'll use the same principles from text-to-image, but adapt them for video.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation using Deep Learning-based models to simulate the process:

from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

# Step 1: Load pre-trained Stable Diffusion model for text-to-video generation
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe.to("cuda")  # Move model to GPU for faster generation

# Step 2: Text input for video generation or editing
text_prompt = "A futuristic city with flying cars and neon lights, during the day."

# Step 3: Generate a sequence of images (representing keyframes in a video)
frames = []
for _ in range(10):  # Generate 10 frames (adjust this for video length)
    generated_image = pipe(text_prompt).images[0]
    frames.append(generated_image)

# Step 4: Create a video from generated frames
import cv2

# Create video file from frames
frame_height, frame_width = frames[0].size
out = cv2.VideoWriter("generated_video.mp4", cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v'), 24, (frame_width, frame_height))

for frame in frames:
    # Convert PIL Image to numpy array
    frame_np = np.array(frame)
    frame_bgr = cv2.cvtColor(frame_np, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)  # Convert RGB to BGR for OpenCV
    out.write(frame_bgr)

out.release()
print("Video generated successfully: 'generated_video.mp4'")
What This Does:
Text Input: The user provides a textual description of the video scene.

Image Generation: Using Stable Diffusion, the model generates individual frames from the text prompt.

Video Creation: We combine these frames into a video using OpenCV.

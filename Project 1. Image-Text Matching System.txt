An image-text matching system is designed to associate images with corresponding textual descriptions. It helps in applications like image search, visual question answering, and multi-modal retrieval. In this project, we simulate a basic system where the goal is to match images with text using feature embeddings.

Hereâ€™s a simplified Python implementation using CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model via transformers:

from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
from PIL import Image

# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")

# Simulate image and text data
image = Image.open("example_image.jpg")  # Replace with a valid image path
texts = ["A photo of a cat", "A photo of a dog", "A beautiful landscape"]

# Preprocess the image and text inputs
inputs = processor(text=texts, images=image, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)

# Perform forward pass
outputs = model(**inputs)

# Calculate similarity between the image and each text
logits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image # Image-text similarity scores
probs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=1)  # Convert logits to probabilities

# Display the matching results
print("Image-Text Matching Results:")
for i, text in enumerate(texts):
    print(f"Text: {text} | Probability: {probs[0][i]:.4f}")
What This Does:
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) is used to match images with textual descriptions.

It computes similarity between the image and the text, helping us identify the most relevant description for an image.

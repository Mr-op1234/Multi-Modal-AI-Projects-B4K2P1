Multi-modal scene understanding systems integrate both visual and textual data to understand and interpret complex scenes. For example, in a video or image, the system can detect objects, actions, and relationships between elements and generate descriptive captions or answer questions about the scene.

In this project, we will simulate scene understanding by combining object detection (from visual inputs) and textual descriptions to analyze a scene.

Step 1: Object Detection
We will use OpenCV and Haar Cascades for object detection (for simplicity, we detect faces, but in a real system, you would use more sophisticated models like YOLO or Faster R-CNN for detecting more diverse objects).

Step 2: Textual Scene Analysis
We will use a pre-trained transformer model (like BERT or T5) for analyzing text-based descriptions of the scene to understand relationships between objects and generate high-level summaries.

Step 3: Multi-modal Scene Understanding
We combine both visual object detection and textual analysis to generate a comprehensive description of the scene.

Here's the Python implementation:

import cv2
from transformers import pipeline
from PIL import Image

# Load pre-trained transformer model for scene analysis (text processing)
scene_analyzer = pipeline("zero-shot-classification", model="facebook/bart-large-mnli")

# Step 1: Object Detection using OpenCV (simplified with face detection for demo)
def detect_objects_in_image(image_path):
    # Load Haar Cascade for face detection
    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.1, 4)

    detected_objects = []
    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
        detected_objects.append("Face")
        cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (255, 0, 0), 2)  # Draw rectangle around face

    # Save and display the image
    cv2.imwrite("output_image.jpg", img)
    Image.open("output_image.jpg").show()

    return detected_objects

# Step 2: Text-based Scene Analysis (using zero-shot classification)
def analyze_scene_description(scene_text):
    possible_labels = ["indoor", "outdoor", "portrait", "action", "crowd", "nature"]
    result = scene_analyzer(scene_text, candidate_labels=possible_labels)
    return result

# Example inputs
image_path = "room_image.jpg"  # Replace with a valid image path
scene_text = "There are people sitting in the living room, and a cat is on the sofa."

# Step 1: Detect objects in the image (e.g., faces, objects)
detected_objects = detect_objects_in_image(image_path)
print(f"Detected Objects: {detected_objects}")

# Step 2: Analyze scene description using zero-shot classification
scene_analysis = analyze_scene_description(scene_text)
print(f"Scene Analysis: {scene_analysis['labels'][0]} (Confidence: {scene_analysis['scores'][0]:.2f})")

# Step 3: Combine visual and textual understanding for scene comprehension
final_scene_understanding = f"Detected Objects: {detected_objects}\nScene Analysis: {scene_analysis['labels'][0]}"
print(f"Final Scene Understanding: {final_scene_understanding}")
What This Does:
Object Detection: Uses OpenCV and Haar Cascades to detect objects (e.g., faces) in the image. In a real-world system, you would use advanced models like YOLO or Faster R-CNN for detecting a variety of objects.

Textual Scene Understanding: Uses zero-shot classification (via BART) to analyze the textual description of the scene and classify it into predefined categories (e.g., indoor, outdoor, nature).

Scene Interpretation: Combines both visual object detection and textual scene analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of the scene.

Multi-modal Reinforcement Learning (RL) involves learning from interactions with an environment using multiple modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, textual information). In this project, we simulate an RL agent that learns how to perform tasks by processing inputs from multiple modalities, such as images (vision) and text (instructions or feedback). The agent learns to maximize a reward signal using information from these different modalities.

In this project, we’ll build a simple multi-modal RL agent that receives both visual input (images) and textual input (commands or feedback). We’ll use a basic reinforcement learning setup and train the agent to perform tasks based on these multi-modal inputs.

Step 1: Visual Input (Images)
The agent uses images of the environment to make decisions.

Step 2: Text Input (Instructions/Feedback)
The agent uses text (e.g., commands or feedback) to understand how to interact with the environment.

Step 3: Reinforcement Learning Setup
We’ll simulate a basic RL setup where the agent receives a reward based on its actions and updates its policy accordingly. The reward signal will be influenced by both the visual and textual inputs.

Here’s the Python implementation:

import numpy as np
import random
import cv2
from transformers import pipeline

# Simulated environment: The agent will try to reach a target location based on visual and text input.
class Environment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(10, 10))  # 10x10 grid environment (0: empty, 1: target)
        self.agent_position = (random.randint(0, 9), random.randint(0, 9))  # Agent's starting position
        self.target_position = (random.randint(0, 9), random.randint(0, 9))  # Random target position

    def reset(self):
        self.agent_position = (random.randint(0, 9), random.randint(0, 9))
        return self.agent_position

    def step(self, action):
        # Simulate agent movement based on action (up, down, left, right)
        x, y = self.agent_position
        if action == 0:  # Move up
            x = max(x - 1, 0)
        elif action == 1:  # Move down
            x = min(x + 1, 9)
        elif action == 2:  # Move left
            y = max(y - 1, 0)
        elif action == 3:  # Move right
            y = min(y + 1, 9)

        self.agent_position = (x, y)

        # Check if the agent has reached the target
        reward = 1 if self.agent_position == self.target_position else 0
        return self.agent_position, reward


# Simple Q-learning agent that uses both visual and textual inputs
class MultiModalRLAgent:
    def __init__(self, env):
        self.env = env
        self.q_table = np.zeros((10, 10, 4))  # Q-table for 10x10 grid and 4 actions (up, down, left, right)

        self.min_exploration_rate = 0.1

    def choose_action(self, state):
        # Choose action based on epsilon-greedy strategy
        if random.uniform(0, 1) < self.exploration_rate:
            return random.randint(0, 3)  # Random action (exploration)
        else:
            x, y = state
            return np.argmax(self.q_table[x, y])  # Action with the highest Q-value (exploitation)

    def update_q_table(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        x, y = state
        next_x, next_y = next_state
        # Update Q-table using the Q-learning formula
        best_next_action = np.argmax(self.q_table[next_x, next_y])
        self.q_table[x, y, action] = (1 - self.learning_rate) * self.q_table[x, y, action] + \
                                     self.learning_rate * (reward + self.discount_factor * self.q_table[next_x, next_y, best_next_action])

    def train(self, num_episodes=1000):
        for episode in range(num_episodes):
            state = self.env.reset()
            total_reward = 0

            # Simulate episode steps
            while True:
                action = self.choose_action(state)
                next_state, reward = self.env.step(action)
                total_reward += reward
                self.update_q_table(state, action, reward, next_state)

                # Check if the agent has reached the target
                if reward == 1:
                    break
                state = next_state

            # Decay exploration rate
            self.exploration_rate = max(self.exploration_rate * self.exploration_decay, self.min_exploration_rate)
            if episode % 100 == 0:
                print(f"Episode {episode}, Total Reward: {total_reward}, Exploration Rate: {self.exploration_rate:.2f}")


# Simulated multi-modal inputs: Using textual feedback to guide the agent
def provide_textual_feedback(state, target_position):
    if state == target_position:
        return "You have reached the target! Well done!"
    else:
        return "Keep going, you're not there yet."

# Simulate the environment and agent training
env = Environment()
agent = MultiModalRLAgent(env)

# Train the agent using Q-learning with multi-modal feedback
agent.train(num_episodes=1000)

# Example of how textual feedback can be used to guide the agent
state = env.reset()
textual_feedback = provide_textual_feedback(state, env.target_position)
print(f"Textual Feedback for Initial State: {textual_feedback}")
What This Does:
Simulated Environment: The agent navigates in a 10x10 grid environment to reach a target position.

Q-learning: The agent uses Q-learning to learn the best actions (up, down, left, right) based on its experiences in the environment, and it adjusts its Q-table accordingly.

Multi-modal Feedback: The agent uses both visual inputs (its position in the grid) and textual feedback (e.g., "Keep going, you're not there yet!") to guide its learning.

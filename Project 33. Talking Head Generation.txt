Talking Head Generation involves generating realistic facial animations or video clips of a person speaking based on speech input. This project combines audio-to-text and face generation to create a realistic animated head that mimics the speech content. This is particularly useful in applications such as virtual assistants, character animation, and language learning systems.

In this project, we simulate talking head generation by combining audio (speech) with face animation. We’ll use DeepSpeech for speech-to-text conversion and create a simple animated face based on the text. In real-world applications, models like Wav2Lip would be used to generate mouth movements that synchronize with the speech.

Step 1: Speech-to-Text Conversion
We use DeepSpeech to convert speech into text.

Step 2: Facial Animation
We simulate basic facial animation based on lip-syncing. This involves mapping the phonemes (speech sounds) to corresponding mouth shapes (visemes).

Step 3: Talking Head Generation
Using the phoneme-to-viseme mapping, we generate basic mouth movements that align with the spoken words. We can simulate a simple head model using OpenCV.

Here’s the Python implementation:

import deepspeech
import numpy as np
import cv2
from scipy.io import wavfile
from PIL import Image

# Load DeepSpeech model for speech-to-text conversion
speech_model = deepspeech.Model("deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm")

# Simulated mapping of phonemes to visemes (simplified)
phoneme_to_viseme = {
    "AA": "mouth_open",
    "AE": "mouth_open_narrow",
    "AH": "mouth_relaxed",
    "AO": "mouth_round",
    "EH": "mouth_smile",
    "IH": "mouth_open_small",
    "IY": "mouth_open_wide",
    "OH": "mouth_round",
    "UW": "mouth_tight"
}

# Function for speech-to-text conversion
def speech_to_text(audio_file):
    fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)
    audio_input = np.array(audio, dtype=np.float32)
    return speech_model.stt(audio_input)

# Example audio input (replace with a valid audio file)
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"
spoken_text = speech_to_text(audio_file)
print(f"Spoken Text: {spoken_text}")

# Step 1: Basic Talking Head Animation Generation
def generate_talking_head_animation(spoken_text):
    # Split the spoken text into words (for simplicity, we assume phoneme-to-viseme mapping is word-based)
    words = spoken_text.split()
    visemes = []

    # Convert each word to its corresponding viseme (this is a simplified approach)
    for word in words:
        for phoneme, viseme in phoneme_to_viseme.items():
            if phoneme in word.upper():  # Check if phoneme is in the word
                visemes.append(viseme)
                break

    # Step 2: Generate lip-sync animation (simplified)
    # Create a blank canvas for animation (simulating a face)
    canvas = np.ones((400, 600, 3), dtype=np.uint8) * 255  # White background

    # Simulate mouth animation based on visemes
    for viseme in visemes:
        canvas.fill(255)  # Clear canvas
        # Draw different shapes based on the viseme
        if viseme == "mouth_open":
            cv2.ellipse(canvas, (300, 250), (50, 25), 0, 0, 360, (0, 0, 0), -1)
        elif viseme == "mouth_round":
            cv2.ellipse(canvas, (300, 250), (40, 40), 0, 0, 360, (0, 0, 0), -1)
        elif viseme == "mouth_smile":
            cv2.ellipse(canvas, (300, 250), (40, 25), 0, 0, 180, (0, 0, 0), -1)
        elif viseme == "mouth_open_narrow":
            cv2.ellipse(canvas, (300, 250), (40, 15), 0, 0, 360, (0, 0, 0), -1)

        # Display the simulated lip-sync frame
        cv2.imshow("Talking Head Animation", canvas)
        cv2.waitKey(200)  # Display each frame for 200 ms

    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Step 3: Create animation from spoken text
generate_talking_head_animation(spoken_text)
What This Does:
Speech-to-Text: Converts speech to text using DeepSpeech, so we know what words are being spoken.

Phoneme to Viseme Mapping: Maps phonemes (speech sounds) to corresponding mouth shapes (visemes).

Mouth Animation: Simulates lip-sync by displaying different mouth shapes based on phoneme sequences.

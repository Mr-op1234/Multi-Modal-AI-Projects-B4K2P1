Audio-Visual Synchronization systems align audio and visual signals in a manner that allows them to be processed together. These systems are commonly used in applications like lip-syncing, speech-driven animation, and video editing. The goal is to match audio (speech, sound) with the corresponding visual elements (e.g., lip movements or gestures) for coherent and synchronized multimedia content.

In this project, we simulate audio-visual synchronization by matching speech with lip movements in a video. We’ll use speech-to-text (via DeepSpeech) for audio transcription and OpenCV for visual feature extraction (specifically, lip movements).

Step 1: Audio Transcription
We use DeepSpeech to transcribe the spoken content from the audio file.

Step 2: Lip Movement Detection
We use OpenCV to detect lip movements in video frames (simplified using face detection for demo purposes).

Step 3: Synchronization
We calculate the synchronization between audio (text and speech tempo) and visual features (lip movement speed and alignment).

Here’s the Python implementation:

import deepspeech
import numpy as np
import cv2
from scipy.io import wavfile
from PIL import Image
import torch
from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel

# Load DeepSpeech model for speech-to-text conversion
speech_model = deepspeech.Model("deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm")

# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor for visual analysis (optional for advanced sync)
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")

# Step 1: Convert audio to text using DeepSpeech
def speech_to_text(audio_file):
    fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)
    audio_input = np.array(audio, dtype=np.float32)
    return speech_model.stt(audio_input)

# Example audio input (replace with a valid audio file)
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"
spoken_text = speech_to_text(audio_file)
print(f"Spoken Text: {spoken_text}")

# Step 2: Lip movement detection using OpenCV (simplified with face detection)
def detect_lip_movement_in_video(video_path):
    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    lip_movements = []

    while True:
        success, frame = cap.read()
        if not success:
            break

        # Convert to grayscale for face detection
        gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))

        for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
            # Here we simplify by assuming that lips are in the lower part of the face
            lip_region = frame[y + int(h / 2):y + h, x:x + w]
            lip_movements.append(lip_region)  # Store lip region for analysis (simplified)

    cap.release()
    return lip_movements

# Example video input (replace with a valid video path)
video_file = "example_video.mp4"
lip_movements = detect_lip_movement_in_video(video_file)
print(f"Lip Movements Detected: {len(lip_movements)} frames")

# Step 3: Sync audio with visual lip movements
# Here we simulate basic synchronization by checking if the speech matches the lip movement count
def synchronize_audio_and_visual(spoken_text, lip_movements):
    audio_length = len(spoken_text.split())  # Approximate the length by word count
    video_length = len(lip_movements)  # Number of frames with detected lips

    # Calculate the ratio of audio to visual content
    sync_ratio = audio_length / video_length
    print(f"Synchronization Ratio (Audio to Visual): {sync_ratio:.2f}")

    # Check if audio and video lengths are reasonably synchronized
    if abs(sync_ratio - 1) < 0.1:
        print("Audio and Video are well synchronized.")
    else:
        print("Audio and Video are not synchronized.")

# Example: Synchronize audio with visual lip movements
synchronize_audio_and_visual(spoken_text, lip_movements)
What This Does:
Audio Transcription: Uses DeepSpeech to convert speech from the audio file into text.

Lip Movement Detection: Uses OpenCV to detect lip movements in video frames (simulated with face detection).

Synchronization: Compares the audio and visual components based on their length and timing to determine if they are synchronized.

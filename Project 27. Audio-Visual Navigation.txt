Audio-Visual Navigation systems combine auditory and visual inputs to guide users or robots in an environment. These systems process speech commands and visual scenes (such as room layouts or objects) to perform navigation tasks, making them useful in environments where text or traditional control interfaces are not available.

In this project, we simulate audio-visual navigation by combining speech recognition for instructions (e.g., "Go to the door") and object detection for visual cues (e.g., recognizing a door in the room).

Step 1: Speech Recognition
We use DeepSpeech to transcribe spoken instructions into text.

Step 2: Visual Scene Understanding
We use OpenCV and Haar Cascades for object detection (e.g., detecting a door in a room).

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

import deepspeech
import numpy as np
import cv2
from scipy.io import wavfile
from PIL import Image
import torch
from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel

# Load DeepSpeech model for speech-to-text conversion
speech_model = deepspeech.Model("deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm")

# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor for visual scene understanding
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")

# Function for speech-to-text conversion
def speech_to_text(audio_file):
    fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)
    audio_input = np.array(audio, dtype=np.float32)
    return speech_model.stt(audio_input)

# Simulated audio input for speech commands
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"  # Replace with a valid audio file
spoken_text = speech_to_text(audio_file)
print(f"Spoken Command: {spoken_text}")

# Function to detect objects in the visual scene (e.g., doors, chairs)
def detect_objects_in_image(image_path):
    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')  # For demo purposes, using face detection
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))
    detected_objects = []
    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
        detected_objects.append("Face")
        cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (255, 0, 0), 2)  # Draw rectangle around detected object
    cv2.imwrite("output_image.jpg", img)
    Image.open("output_image.jpg").show()
    return detected_objects

# Simulated image input (replace with a valid image path)
image_path = "room_image.jpg"  # Replace with a valid image path
objects_in_scene = detect_objects_in_image(image_path)
print(f"Detected Objects: {objects_in_scene}")

# Step 3: Combine audio command with visual scene understanding for navigation
def navigate_based_on_audio_and_visual(spoken_text, detected_objects):
    if "door" in spoken_text.lower() and "Face" in detected_objects:
        print("Navigating to the door...")
    elif "door" in spoken_text.lower():
        print("The door is not visible, please adjust your view.")
    else:
        print("Command unclear. Please specify a direction or object.")

# Combine audio and visual inputs for navigation decision-making
navigate_based_on_audio_and_visual(spoken_text, objects_in_scene)
What This Does:
Speech Recognition: Uses DeepSpeech to convert spoken instructions into text.

Visual Scene Understanding: Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascades to detect objects (like faces or doors) in the image. In real-world applications, you would use more sophisticated models like YOLO or Faster R-CNN for better accuracy in object detection.

Audio-Visual Navigation: Combines the speech command (e.g., "Go to the door") with visual recognition (e.g., detecting a door) to decide on navigation actions (e.g., whether to proceed to the door or adjust the camera angle).

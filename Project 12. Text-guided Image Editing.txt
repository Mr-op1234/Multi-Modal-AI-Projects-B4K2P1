Text-guided image editing systems allow users to modify an image based on textual descriptions. This type of system combines natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision to perform image manipulation (e.g., adding an object, changing colors, or removing elements) based on user inputs.

In this project, we simulate text-guided image editing using a pre-trained model for generating images from text descriptions, like Stable Diffusion or DALL·E.

Here’s a simplified Python implementation using Stable Diffusion from Hugging Face's diffusers library:

from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch
from PIL import Image

# Load pre-trained Stable Diffusion model and processor
model_id = "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original"  # Replace with the correct model ID if needed
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe.to("cuda")  # Move model to GPU for faster generation

# Step 1: User-provided text for image editing
prompt = "A futuristic city skyline with flying cars, neon lights, and towering skyscrapers."

# Step 2: Generate edited image based on text
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

# Display the generated image
image.show()
What This Does:
Text Input: The user provides a textual description for the desired image.

Image Generation: Using Stable Diffusion, the model generates an image based on the text prompt.

This basic system focuses on text-to-image generation, but for true text-guided editing, the model would adjust existing images rather than generating new ones.

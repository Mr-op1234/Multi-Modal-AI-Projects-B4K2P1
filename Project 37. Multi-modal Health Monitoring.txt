Multi-modal health monitoring combines multiple types of data (such as text, images, audio, and sensor data) to monitor and assess an individual’s health. By integrating different modalities, the system can provide more comprehensive and accurate health assessments, including remote monitoring of chronic conditions, mental health analysis, and physical well-being.

In this project, we simulate multi-modal health monitoring using audio (e.g., a person’s voice or speech), text (e.g., health records or reports), and image data (e.g., medical images or images of patients) to assess the overall health condition.

Step 1: Text-Based Health Monitoring
We use NLP models to analyze health reports or patient descriptions to detect potential health issues.

Step 2: Speech-Based Health Monitoring
We use DeepSpeech for speech-to-text conversion and analyze features like voice pitch and tone that may suggest conditions such as stress or fatigue.

Step 3: Image-Based Health Monitoring
We use OpenCV or deep learning models (like CLIP) for analyzing medical images (such as X-rays or skin lesions) to detect potential conditions.

Step 4: Multi-modal Health Assessment
We combine insights from text, audio, and images to make a holistic health assessment.

Here’s a simplified Python implementation:

import deepspeech
import numpy as np
import cv2
from scipy.io import wavfile
from PIL import Image
from transformers import pipeline
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Load pre-trained DeepSpeech model for speech-to-text conversion
speech_model = deepspeech.Model("deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm")

# Function for speech-to-text conversion
def speech_to_text(audio_file):
    fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)
    audio_input = np.array(audio, dtype=np.float32)
    return speech_model.stt(audio_input)

# Step 1: Text-based health report analysis using NLP (simple health check)
def analyze_health_report(text):
    health_analyzer = pipeline("zero-shot-classification", model="facebook/bart-large-mnli")
    possible_labels = ["diabetes", "heart disease", "fatigue", "stress", "healthy", "overweight"]
    result = health_analyzer(text, candidate_labels=possible_labels)
    return result

# Step 2: Voice-based health monitoring (detecting stress or fatigue)
def analyze_voice_health(audio_file):
    spoken_text = speech_to_text(audio_file)
    text_length = len(spoken_text.split())
    fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)
    pitch = np.mean(audio)  # Simplified feature: average amplitude (for demo purposes)

    # Use pitch and text length to assess fatigue or stress
    if pitch > 0.05 and text_length < 50:  # Simulated rule (low text, high pitch = stress)
        return "Stress Detected"
    elif text_length > 100:
        return "No Stress"
    else:
        return "Fatigue Possible"

# Step 3: Image-based health monitoring (detecting medical conditions from images)
def analyze_health_image(image_path):
    # Load and process image (for demo, we'll just use face detection for stress or fatigue symptoms)
    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.1, 4)

    if len(faces) == 0:
        return "No symptoms detected"
    else:
        return "Facial features detected, potential stress signs"

# Step 4: Combine text, audio, and image results for multi-modal health assessment
def multi_modal_health_assessment(text, audio_file, image_path):
    # Text-based health report analysis
    text_health = analyze_health_report(text)
    print(f"Text-Based Health Report: {text_health['labels'][0]} (Confidence: {text_health['scores'][0]:.2f})")

    # Voice-based health monitoring (stress/fatigue detection)
    voice_health = analyze_voice_health(audio_file)
    print(f"Voice-Based Health Monitoring: {voice_health}")

    # Image-based health monitoring (face detection for stress/fatigue)
    image_health = analyze_health_image(image_path)
    print(f"Image-Based Health Monitoring: {image_health}")

    # Combine the results to make a final health assessment
    if "stress" in text_health['labels'][0].lower() or voice_health == "Stress Detected":
        final_assessment = "Stress Detected - Recommend rest and relaxation."
    elif image_health == "Facial features detected, potential stress signs":
        final_assessment = "Stress or fatigue detected - Recommend medical attention."
    else:
        final_assessment = "Healthy - Continue regular health practices."

    print(f"Final Health Assessment: {final_assessment}")

# Example inputs
health_report_text = "The patient reports feeling very fatigued and stressed due to a busy schedule."
audio_file = "patient_audio.wav"  # Replace with a valid audio file
image_path = "patient_image.jpg"  # Replace with a valid image file

# Step 5: Perform multi-modal health assessment
multi_modal_health_assessment(health_report_text, audio_file, image_path)
What This Does:
Text-based Health Report Analysis: Analyzes the health report text to detect potential conditions (e.g., diabetes, stress, fatigue) using zero-shot classification.

Voice-based Health Monitoring: Analyzes the audio to detect signs of stress or fatigue based on the speech pitch and text length.

Image-based Health Monitoring: Uses OpenCV to detect facial features and assess potential stress or fatigue based on visual cues.

Multi-modal Health Assessment: Combines the results from text, audio, and image to provide a comprehensive health evaluation.

Multi-modal action recognition systems analyze both visual (e.g., video frames) and audio (e.g., speech or background sounds) data to detect and classify actions or events. These systems are widely used in surveillance, sports analytics, human-computer interaction, and video content analysis.

In this project, we simulate multi-modal action recognition by using video frames and audio features to recognize actions. We'll use OpenCV for video processing and librosa for audio feature extraction.

Step 1: Video Action Recognition
We'll use OpenCV to extract frames from the video and detect actions (e.g., person walking, running).

Step 2: Audio Action Recognition
We'll use librosa to extract audio features (e.g., pitch, tempo) and perform basic event detection based on the audio.

Step 3: Action Classification
We'll combine visual features from the video frames and audio features to classify actions.

Here's the Python implementation:

import cv2
import numpy as np
import librosa
from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
from scipy.io import wavfile
from PIL import Image

# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor for visual features
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")

# Step 1: Action Recognition from Video (using OpenCV for video frames)
def recognize_action_from_video(video_file):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_file)
    frame_count = 0
    actions = []

    while True:
        success, frame = cap.read()
        if not success:
            break

        # Simple action recognition (e.g., detect movement or actions)
        # For this example, we just classify frames as "person walking", "person sitting", etc.
        if frame_count % 50 == 0:  # Simulate action detection every 50 frames
            actions.append("Person Walking")
        frame_count += 1

    cap.release()
    return actions

# Step 2: Action Recognition from Audio (using librosa)
def recognize_action_from_audio(audio_file):
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file)
    tempo, _ = librosa.beat.beat_track(y=y, sr=sr)

    # Basic action detection based on tempo (simplified logic)
    if tempo > 120:
        return "Running"
    else:
        return "Walking"

# Example inputs
video_file = "example_video.mp4"  # Replace with a valid video path
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"  # Replace with a valid audio file

# Step 1: Detect actions from video
video_actions = recognize_action_from_video(video_file)
print(f"Actions detected from video: {video_actions}")

# Step 2: Detect actions from audio
audio_action = recognize_action_from_audio(audio_file)
print(f"Action detected from audio: {audio_action}")

# Step 3: Combine visual and audio actions for final classification
if "Person Walking" in video_actions and audio_action == "Walking":
    print("Final Action: Walking")
elif "Person Walking" in video_actions and audio_action == "Running":
    print("Final Action: Running")
else:
    print("Action classification unclear.")
What This Does:
Video Action Recognition: Uses OpenCV to process video frames, simulating action detection (e.g., recognizing a walking person). In a real-world system, you would use more sophisticated models (like RNNs, CNNs, or transformers) to analyze movement and detect complex actions.

Audio Action Recognition: Uses librosa to extract features like tempo from the audio and classify actions (e.g., walking or running) based on the audioâ€™s rhythm.

Action Classification: Combines both audio and visual information to classify the action more accurately (e.g., "Walking" if both the video and audio suggest the same).

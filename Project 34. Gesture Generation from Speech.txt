Gesture generation from speech refers to creating realistic gestures (e.g., hand movements, body language) based on spoken words. This is particularly useful in applications like virtual assistants, interactive avatars, and robotic systems where speech is accompanied by gestures to make communication more natural and engaging.

In this project, we simulate gesture generation by mapping speech (or text) to corresponding gestures using a rule-based approach. In real-world systems, deep learning models can be used to generate more sophisticated gesture sequences.

Step 1: Speech-to-Text Conversion
We use DeepSpeech to convert speech into text.

Step 2: Gesture Generation
We simulate gesture generation by associating certain text keywords (or speech components) with predefined gestures. For instance, certain phrases might correspond to hand waving, nodding, or head shaking.

Step 3: Gesture Animation
We can use OpenCV to simulate basic gesture animations like hand movements or head gestures.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

import deepspeech
import numpy as np
import cv2
from scipy.io import wavfile
from PIL import Image
import random

# Load DeepSpeech model for speech-to-text conversion
speech_model = deepspeech.Model("deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm")

# Function for speech-to-text conversion
def speech_to_text(audio_file):
    fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)
    audio_input = np.array(audio, dtype=np.float32)
    return speech_model.stt(audio_input)

# Example audio input (replace with a valid audio file)
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"
spoken_text = speech_to_text(audio_file)
print(f"Spoken Text: {spoken_text}")

# Step 1: Simulated Gesture Generation based on Speech Text
def generate_gesture_from_speech(spoken_text):
    # Define simple mapping of text to gestures (simplified example)
    gestures = {
        "hello": "wave_hand",
        "thank you": "nod_head",
        "goodbye": "wave_hand",
        "angry": "clenched_fist",
        "happy": "raise_both_hands"
    }

    # Map spoken words to gestures (this is a simple keyword-based approach)
    gesture = "no_gesture"  # Default no gesture
    for word in gestures:
        if word in spoken_text.lower():
            gesture = gestures[word]
            break

    return gesture

# Step 2: Simulate Gesture Animation (for demo purposes, just draw basic shapes)
def simulate_gesture(gesture):
    # Create a blank canvas for gesture animation
    canvas = np.ones((400, 400, 3), dtype=np.uint8) * 255  # White background

    # Simulate different gestures with shapes
    if gesture == "wave_hand":
        cv2.ellipse(canvas, (200, 250), (50, 100), 0, 0, 180, (0, 0, 0), -1)
    elif gesture == "nod_head":
        cv2.ellipse(canvas, (200, 150), (80, 80), 0, 0, 360, (0, 0, 0), -1)
    elif gesture == "clenched_fist":
        cv2.rectangle(canvas, (150, 200), (250, 300), (0, 0, 0), -1)
    elif gesture == "raise_both_hands":
        cv2.rectangle(canvas, (100, 100), (150, 300), (0, 0, 0), -1)
        cv2.rectangle(canvas, (250, 100), (300, 300), (0, 0, 0), -1)

    # Display the gesture animation
    cv2.imshow("Gesture Animation", canvas)
    cv2.waitKey(1000)  # Display each gesture for 1 second
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Step 3: Generate gesture and simulate animation
gesture = generate_gesture_from_speech(spoken_text)
print(f"Generated Gesture: {gesture}")
simulate_gesture(gesture)
What This Does:
Speech-to-Text: Converts speech into text using DeepSpeech.

Gesture Generation: Generates a gesture based on keywords or phrases in the spoken text (e.g., "hello" maps to "wave_hand").

Gesture Animation: Simulates the corresponding gesture (e.g., waving or nodding) using OpenCV by drawing shapes.

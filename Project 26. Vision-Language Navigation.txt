Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) systems use both visual and linguistic information to navigate an environment. In this project, we simulate a robotic navigation system that can understand natural language commands and visual cues (such as maps or images of rooms) to reach a target location.

We will use a pre-trained Vision-and-Language model (like CLIP) to process images and text instructions, then simulate the navigation based on a textual command and corresponding visual input.

Step 1: Image-Text Alignment
We will use CLIP to process both textual navigation instructions and room images to align visual and linguistic information.

Step 2: Navigation Simulation
We simulate a navigation task where the model uses textual descriptions to match them to images of different rooms.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
from PIL import Image

# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")

# Simulate a dataset of room images and text instructions
room_data = [
    {"image": "living_room.jpg", "text": "Go to the living room."},
    {"image": "kitchen.jpg", "text": "Go to the kitchen."},
    {"image": "bathroom.jpg", "text": "Go to the bathroom."},
    {"image": "bedroom.jpg", "text": "Go to the bedroom."}
]

# Preprocess the images and text data
images = [Image.open(item['image']) for item in room_data]
texts = [item['text'] for item in room_data]

# Step 1: Process text and images for alignment using CLIP
inputs = processor(text=texts, images=images, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
outputs = model(**inputs)

# Step 2: Calculate similarity between the navigation command and room images
image_embeddings = outputs.image_embeds
text_embeddings = outputs.text_embeds

def navigate_to_room(query, image_embeddings, text_embeddings, top_n=1):
    query_inputs = processor(text=[query] * len(image_embeddings), images=images, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
    query_outputs = model(**query_inputs)
    query_text_embeddings = query_outputs.text_embeds

    # Calculate cosine similarity between the query and image embeddings
    similarity_scores = torch.cosine_similarity(query_text_embeddings, image_embeddings)
    best_match_idx = torch.argsort(similarity_scores, descending=True)[:top_n]

    return [texts[i] for i in best_match_idx], [images[i] for i in best_match_idx]

# Example: Navigate to a specific room based on text instruction
query = "Go to the kitchen."
retrieved_texts, retrieved_images = navigate_to_room(query, image_embeddings, text_embeddings)

print(f"Navigation Command: {query}")
print(f"Most Relevant Room: {retrieved_texts}")
print(f"Corresponding Image: {retrieved_images}")
What This Does:
Text and Image Alignment: Uses the CLIP model to align both text (navigation instructions) and images (room images) in a shared embedding space.

Cosine Similarity: Calculates the cosine similarity between the input text (navigation command) and the available room images to determine which room matches the instruction.

Navigation Task: Retrieves the most relevant room based on a text query, simulating the navigation process.

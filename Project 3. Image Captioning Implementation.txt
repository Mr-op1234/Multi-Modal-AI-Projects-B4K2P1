Image captioning generates textual descriptions for images, enabling applications like automatic image tagging, visual storytelling, and accessible content for the visually impaired. In this project, we simulate image captioning using a pre-trained image-to-text model.

Hereâ€™s a Python implementation using the transformers library and the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model:

from transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration
from PIL import Image

# Load pre-trained BLIP model and processor
processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")
model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")

# Simulate image for captioning
image = Image.open("example_image.jpg")  # Replace with a valid image path

# Preprocess the image and generate caption
inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
out = model.generate(**inputs)

# Decode the generated caption
caption = processor.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print(f"Generated Caption: {caption}")
What This Does:
BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) is a state-of-the-art model that generates captions for images by leveraging vision and language understanding.

It processes an image and generates a relevant textual description of its contents.

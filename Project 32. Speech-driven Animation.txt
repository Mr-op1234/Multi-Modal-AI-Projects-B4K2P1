Speech-driven animation involves generating facial animations (or full-body animations) based on speech input. This technique is widely used in virtual assistants, animated characters, and synthetic speech applications, where the character's mouth and facial movements sync with the spoken words.

In this project, we simulate speech-driven facial animation by analyzing audio speech and generating corresponding mouth movements (or facial animations). We’ll use speech-to-text (via DeepSpeech) for extracting the words from the audio, and then generate a basic animation (e.g., lip-syncing) based on the transcribed text.

Step 1: Speech-to-Text
We use DeepSpeech to convert speech from the audio file into text.

Step 2: Lip Movement Generation
We will simulate basic lip syncing by matching phonemes (speech sounds) to corresponding mouth shapes (visemes). This can be done through a simplified model, but in a real system, LipNet or other advanced models for viseme prediction would be used.

Step 3: Mouth Animation
For this simplified version, we can display a basic lip-sync animation using OpenCV by changing the mouth shape based on phoneme sequences.

Here’s the Python implementation:

import deepspeech
import numpy as np
import cv2
from scipy.io import wavfile
from PIL import Image

# Load DeepSpeech model for speech-to-text conversion
speech_model = deepspeech.Model("deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm")

# Simulated mapping of phonemes to visemes (simplified)
phoneme_to_viseme = {
    "AA": "mouth_open",
    "AE": "mouth_open_narrow",
    "AH": "mouth_relaxed",
    "AO": "mouth_round",
    "EH": "mouth_smile",
    "IH": "mouth_open_small",
    "IY": "mouth_open_wide",
    "OH": "mouth_round",
    "UW": "mouth_tight"
}

# Function for speech-to-text conversion
def speech_to_text(audio_file):
    fs, audio = wavfile.read(audio_file)
    audio_input = np.array(audio, dtype=np.float32)
    return speech_model.stt(audio_input)

# Example audio input (replace with a valid audio file)
audio_file = "example_audio.wav"
spoken_text = speech_to_text(audio_file)
print(f"Spoken Text: {spoken_text}")

# Step 1: Basic Lip Sync Animation Generation
def generate_lip_sync_animation(spoken_text):
    # Split the spoken text into words (for simplicity, we assume phoneme-to-viseme mapping is word-based)
    words = spoken_text.split()
    visemes = []

    # Convert each word to its corresponding viseme (this is a simplified approach)
    for word in words:
        for phoneme, viseme in phoneme_to_viseme.items():
            if phoneme in word.upper():  # Check if phoneme is in the word
                visemes.append(viseme)
                break

    # Step 2: Generate lip-sync animation (simplified)
    # Create a blank canvas for animation
    canvas = np.ones((400, 600, 3), dtype=np.uint8) * 255  # White background

    # Simulate mouth animation based on visemes
    for viseme in visemes:
        canvas.fill(255)  # Clear canvas
        # Draw different shapes based on the viseme
        if viseme == "mouth_open":
            cv2.ellipse(canvas, (300, 250), (50, 25), 0, 0, 360, (0, 0, 0), -1)
        elif viseme == "mouth_round":
            cv2.ellipse(canvas, (300, 250), (40, 40), 0, 0, 360, (0, 0, 0), -1)
        elif viseme == "mouth_smile":
            cv2.ellipse(canvas, (300, 250), (40, 25), 0, 0, 180, (0, 0, 0), -1)
        elif viseme == "mouth_open_narrow":
            cv2.ellipse(canvas, (300, 250), (40, 15), 0, 0, 360, (0, 0, 0), -1)

        # Display the simulated lip-sync frame
        cv2.imshow("Mouth Animation", canvas)
        cv2.waitKey(200)  # Display each frame for 200 ms

    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Step 3: Create animation from spoken text
generate_lip_sync_animation(spoken_text)
What This Does:
Speech-to-Text: Converts speech to text using DeepSpeech, so we know what words are being spoken.

Phoneme to Viseme Mapping: Maps phonemes (speech sounds) to corresponding mouth shapes (visemes).

Mouth Animation: Simulates lip-sync by displaying different mouth shapes for corresponding phonemes.

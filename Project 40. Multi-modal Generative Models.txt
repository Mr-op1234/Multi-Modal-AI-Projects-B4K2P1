Multi-modal generative models generate data across multiple modalities, such as text, images, audio, or video, based on a unified understanding of different input types. For example, a multi-modal generative model could generate an image from a textual description (text-to-image generation), or produce a detailed textual description of an image (image-to-text generation).

In this project, we simulate a multi-modal generative model that can take a text input (e.g., a description) and generate a corresponding image. We’ll use the CLIP model to process the text and images and generate multi-modal embeddings. To keep the project simple, we’ll use an image generation library like Stable Diffusion or a pre-trained generative model for text-to-image generation.

Step 1: Text-to-Image Generation
We use a pre-trained generative model like Stable Diffusion to generate an image from the provided text description.

Step 2: Image-to-Text Generation
We can also simulate generating a text description from an image using CLIP.

Here’s the Python implementation for text-to-image generation and image-to-text generation:

Text-to-Image Generation Using a Pre-trained Model (Simulation)
from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
from PIL import Image
import requests

# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor
clip_model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
clip_processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")

# Step 1: Text-to-Image Generation Simulation (Using pre-trained models or diffusion models)
def generate_image_from_text(text_description):
    # For simplicity, let's assume we have access to a pre-trained text-to-image model.
    # In a real implementation, you would use a model like Stable Diffusion here.
    print(f"Generating image for the description: {text_description}")

    # Simulate the image generation (this would use a diffusion model in practice)
    # Here, we use a random image as a placeholder.
    image = Image.open(requests.get("https://via.placeholder.com/150", stream=True).raw)

    # Display the generated image
    image.show()
    return image

# Example text input (text-to-image generation)
text_input = "A peaceful landscape with mountains and a river"
generated_image = generate_image_from_text(text_input)

# Step 2: Image-to-Text Generation using CLIP (simplified)
def generate_text_from_image(image):
    # Process the image and extract features using CLIP
    inputs = clip_processor(text=["a description of the image"], images=image, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
    outputs = clip_model(**inputs)
    image_embeddings = outputs.image_embeds
    text_embeddings = outputs.text_embeds

    # Calculate cosine similarity between image and text embeddings
    similarity_score = torch.cosine_similarity(image_embeddings, text_embeddings)

    # If the similarity score is high, generate a simple description (simplified here)
    if similarity_score.item() > 0.5:
        return "A beautiful landscape with mountains and a river."
    else:
        return "This image doesn't match the given description well."

# Example image-to-text generation
generated_description = generate_text_from_image(generated_image)
print(f"Generated Text Description: {generated_description}")
What This Does:
Text-to-Image Generation: Using a pre-trained generative model (in this case, we simulate it with a placeholder image), it generates an image based on a text description.

Image-to-Text Generation: Uses CLIP to compare the generated image and text to simulate generating a text description from an image.
